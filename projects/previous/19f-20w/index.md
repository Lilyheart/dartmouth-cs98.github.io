# ForTheGirls 19S-20W #

> For the Girls is a mobile application that connects women in technology based on technical and personal interests and location. Women can choose to be a mentor, mentee or looking for friends. Once women match, they can DM each other to see if they want to meet up in person for coffee or a meal. Through reminders, an events page and personality matching, we hope that the relationships and networks built through the app will last. Our goal is to alleviate feelings of isolation and imposter syndrome through building a strong network of women in technology.

# Meetingz 19S-20W #

> Meetings are important, but there are a lot of problems. They often go over their allotted amount of time without coming up with solutions, and they also disregard those who don't feel as comfortable contributing vocally to meetings, thus missing out good ideas. We are building an app that will help inexperienced meeting leaders lead meetings more efficiently by implementing a solution that will interact with the meeting in some way. It will also display statistics about a meeting after the meeting.
