# BearTrax 19W-19S #

> Bear Trax (formerly WittyCare) is a health/fitness app for IOS that uses a virtual avatar, a bear named Witty, to reward and to motivate users to stay fit. The app integrates with Apple's HealthKit in order to keep track of user's steps and flights of stairs walked each day. The more users walk, the happier Witty is. In addition to keeping Witty happy, users are also rewarded with coins the more they walk. These coins can be used to unlock a story about Witty's adventures. Finally, users can add friends and create challenges with them by betting coins on who can walk the most steps or flights of stairs.

# NavSight 19W-19S #

> We are building a proof of concept application using deep learning, car diagnostics technology, and wearable technology to aid the visually impaired in crossing the streets more safely. Our final product consisted of a belt with haptic buzzers for navigation, a working walk signal detection model, and real-time car tracking with an OBD for additional safety, and a mobile app for the end user.

# OpusMatch 19W-19S #

> Identifying potentially promising academics to recruit is a nontrivial challenge to college recruitment boards. Many extremely talented individuals never consider a career in academia until they are contacted by a recruiter for a college. This suggests that many people who could become great professors never consider the profession due to the difficulty associated with identifying them. With this project we set out to identify certain individuals who would be likely to exhibit high growth in their h-indices over the next few years, based on their position in the network of published academic research by proposing a modified PageRank algorithm as well as through scraping ResearchGate and doing a graphical analysis on the networks of mentors/mentees/contributors.
