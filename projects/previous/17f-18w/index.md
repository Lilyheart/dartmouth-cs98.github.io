# MeshCash 17F-18W #

> In natural disasters or any situation in which networks are down or not reachable, it can be difficult to access funds that are stored in a bank account. People still need access to their funds or at least a way to keep a record of transactions that will be updated and settled when a user has access to a network. MeshCash is our answer. MeshCash is an iOS app based on a mesh network, which will allow for effective communication without reliance on wifi/cellular network. Users will use local WiFi or Bluetooth to connect to nearby devices. Users can then “pay” one another even while not connected to a cell network and receive/send the actual funds once reconnected to a network. The rest of the world will be updated once a member/members of the mesh are able to connect.
