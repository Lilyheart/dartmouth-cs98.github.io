## Overview 

It is time to revisit your goals and see how you are doing.  In particular,you should try to imagine where you want to be at the end of this term and during it! Think about what you want to get out of the class, and what success means for you **individually**. 

## Review

Take a look at your wiki pages: original project proposal, feature spec, summary, feedback etc from this past term. What did you mark as stretch goals? How much does that vision reflect where you are now? Think about how the project went this past term and feedback received.

Think about what would personally be a goal that you would love to see implemented by the end of term.  What would make you extra proud of the project.  Is it something you had already personally hoped would be part of the core functionality?  Why isn't it and what is the limitation?  Don't try to game the system and choose all easy things btw, we can tell. Think about what you'd like to accomplish and what might be standing in the way.
