title: Term 1 - Term 2 Extra Credit
published: true

## Progress Counts!

Some of you have asked if work during interim counts â€” it sure does!

This is an extra credit assignment - and is a nice way to bump up your contribution to the project. Obviously any work on the project helps the final project grade, assuming the work you do helps the project, but this is a little extra incentive for the individual grade.

This is not a team EC but rather individual, but you can obviously plan on doing it as a team and if you do any team meetings you should count that as effort.

## USE ZenHub!

ðŸš€  Create a new milestone called `term1-term2`

Add whatever issues you work on to this milestone - you don't have to do any sort of weekly sprints but just make sure to specify what you're working on similarly to how you would during term.  Create some issues, move them to 'In Progress' when you are actively working on them. Assign to yourself. 

## Work that qualifies:

* **code PRs**: Do the same as you do during term, record your work in zenhub issues, mark your hours, submit links on canvas to each closed zenhub issue 
* recorded research on the project: Start a zenhub ticket and comment in sources and how you think they relate / are helpful to the project. 
* **catchup tutorial work**:   If you feel you are behind on any of the tech stacks - this is a chance to catch up. Create separate repos similar to the hack-a-things with readme files to record what you learned and how it relates.  Basically just do more Hack-a-things. Submit links on canvas to them.
* **conduct user research**:  Using what you built last term, conduct user research, document it all in wiki pages and submit links here.  This is your chance to talk about your project with people from other walks of life / your actual target audience and get feedback.  We'll start the term off strong and use any feedback to inform any pivots or course corrections.
* **design work**:  Work on fixing up any designs based on feedback etc.  Work in Figma and document it as zenhub issues.
* let me know if I'm missing anything in this list that would help the project / your learning objectives.
 

Have a great break!  Can't wait to see you all next term!
