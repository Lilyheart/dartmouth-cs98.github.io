## Overview 

It is time to revisit your team goals and see how you are doing.  In particular, you should try to imagine where you want to be in 4 weeks. And most importantly, let us think about what success means for us, individually, as a team, as a product, and as a class.


## Part 1: Personal

Take a look at your wiki pages: original project proposal, feature spec, and more importantly the [self-reflection](project-self-reflection) from this term.   What did you mark as stretch goals?  How much does that vision reflect where you are now?

Think about what would personally be a goal that you would love to see implemented by the end of term.  Think about what would make you extra proud of the project.  Is it something you had already personally hoped would be part of the core functionality?  Why isn't it and what is the limitation?  Don't try to game the system and choose all easy things btw, we can tell. Think about what you'd like to accomplish and what might be standing in the way.


### Personal ZenHub Issue

ðŸš€ **Create** a ZenHub issue on your project repo following this template and assign it to *yourself* **and** `@katesalesin` and `@timofei7`. **label** it with <span style="color: gold">[goals]</span>

```markdown
# Title: Name | Personal Goals
*what does success for this class mean to you?*

* ex: i learn redux and make some cool complex logic
* ex: i am able to show my work off in my portfolio
* ex: i get a citation in this class to show off to all my friends
* ex: i get complex feature x working because i really care about it
* ex: we ship the product and it changes the world

## Challenges
*what are some challenges you foresee?*
```


## Part 2: Team

As a team, gather your ideas together and go around and let everyone discuss where they see the project headed and propose some success metrics and goals for the group as a whole. 

## Wiki Page

Create a wiki page on your github repo called: `Success Metrics and Validation Plan`


```markdown
# Success Metrics and Validation Plan

## Team Goals
*Discuss and identify any team goals that you think would be important to tackle.*

* ex: we finish complex features x, y, z as they are critical to our product
* ex: we need to include this additional stretch goal as it is very cool
* ex: we want to try including analytics and doing advertising

## Success Metrics
*what are some success metrics for you as a team?*

* ex: we publish and get 100 people to download it
* ex: we don't kill each other one week before demos
* ex: we show that our process works with numerical analysis of performance data
* ex: we are the favorite team and we get a lunch voucher to get brunch with the prof

## Validation Plan
*now comes the hard part, the validation plan. how do you get from goals to success metrics that are validated?*

* ex: we use analytics to show that feature x is important
* ex: we plan to demo our product to 50 people and observe and survey them to show that our product is impactful
* ex: we will use a set of tests to run our product through its steps and see how it performs in a preset number of situations
