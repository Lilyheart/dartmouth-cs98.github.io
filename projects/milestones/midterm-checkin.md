## In Class

* be prepared to show a working demo to your peers


## To Turn In:
* Individually, a link to 2 PRs that you are proud of with a couple of sentences about why you are proud of it and how it was important for the project. Remember you should all be doing pull requests - not pushing commits directly.
* Donâ€™t forget to try for 3-5 closed issues on github per person per week.
