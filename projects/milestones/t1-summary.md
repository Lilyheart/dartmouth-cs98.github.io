## Focus on MVP and TESTING


Create a new Wiki page on your repo: `T1 Summary and User Testing`

Template to get you started is included, but mostly the idea is to record feedback and notes to yourselves for next term.

```markdown

# T1 Summary and User Testing

## Summary
*Summarize your user testing and any feedback you got during demos.* 

#### Observations 
*Record your observations and any insights/conclusions you may have about them. Identify top patterns and write them up. Record the number of email signups you got.*

#### Analysis
*Is there any analysis you can do of the testing - what percentage of users claimed X or Y.  If you had numerical answers was there any statistical significance to the answers?*

#### Notes To Future Us
*Leave notes to yourself for next term - what should your next steps be?*

## TeamWork 
*Reflect on how your team is working together*

#### What has been working well?
*give kudos and shoutouts, comment on communication techniques that have worked, pr review practices, etc*

#### What has not?
*try to discuss any problems openly and respectfully. communication breakdowns? are some teammembers taking others tasks for themselves? is anybody ghosting? etc*

#### Steps
*if there are problems, think of some ways to resolve them, go back to your team contract from last term to see what you said you would do for resolution*

```
