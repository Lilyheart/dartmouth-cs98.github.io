## Focus on MVP and TESTING

Create a new Wiki page on your repo: `T1 Summary and User Testing`

Summarize your user testing and any feedback you got during demos. Record your observations and any insights/conclusions you may have about them. Identify top patterns and write them up.

Record the number of email signups you got.

Is there any analysis you can do of the testing - what percentage of users claimed X or Y.  If you had numerical answers was there any statistical significance to the answers?

Leave notes to yourself for next term - what should your next steps be?


## READMEs

Update all the `README.md` files in your repos with up-to-date installation and setup instructions. Include any gotchas and architectural details you think important for replicating your setup.

REMINDER: Grades for this term will be "ONGOING" in banner.
