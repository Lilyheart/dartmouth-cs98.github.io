This is the time to plan out your milestones for this term. We will do fewer general milestones but will instead focus on custom milestones for your individual projects.

As you think about your milestones, consider any feedback you collected during taco testing and carefully prioritize your features. You have 9 weeks to turn your current beta MVP into a polished (and fully working!) final product!  Think about your critical features and accommodate them first.  Make sure your user flow works and makes sense.  At week 5 we will have midterm presentations so that will be another chance for you to get more feedback and iterate and refine further. So the next working iteration of the product should be ready for week 5.

## GitHub Milestones

Enter in your milestones on your project github repos.  At this point create at least a milestone per week up through week 5. Enter in due dates for each. Give your best shot at these, they should be more specific than "make progress for week 2".  They should be less specific than "create login button" (this is an issue rather than a milestone). Examples include: "login and user profile flow",  "event review functionality", "fully integrate current flows with api".  You can change these around later, but for now do put some thought into them.

## Issues

Each milestone now needs to be split up into multiple issues.  You can think of the issues as individual tasks: "create login button",  "api endpoint for user profile", etc.  Issues can also be bugs that you find along the way.  You should assign people to each issue as you work on them so your team knows who is doing what. For now, populate the first few milestones with some tasks!  Break up large tasks into individual smaller ones, each one should be under a few hours of work. The smaller the tasks the actually faster you will work (not just the appearance of speed).  It is easier to take on a manageable scope issue and work through it than if the issue has multiple steps that quickly become overwhelming to think through.  Feel free to assign each other tasks, a little aggressiveness is ok!

You should have at least 1 assigned issue per team member for your first milestone.


## Bug Fixes
Do you have any bugs left from last term?  Now's a good time to triage them and see which you want to fix and which might go away depending on how your product evolves, etc.  If you haven't made them into github issues you should! Here's some good labels that you should use to help prioritize.

* <font style="color:orange">[important]</font>
* <font style="color:lightblue">[back burner]</font>
* <font style="color:grey">[won't fix]</font>


## To Turn In:
* github links to milestones in issues
* if you have multiple repos you might want to have milestones entered in both - they can be the same or specific (for instance server vs frontend might have different milestones). Submit links to each. Not the same issues usually of course.
* work on and close a few issues, in fact since you have some time, complete your first milestone or two. Let's front load this term and get a lot done in the next couple of weeks. Submit links to any closed issues.
