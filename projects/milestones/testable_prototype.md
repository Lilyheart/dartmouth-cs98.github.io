At this stage you should be working towards a testable prototype,  it should be close to your MVP. Focus on function over form for this milestone.  You should be able to demonstrate all the main critical functionality of your app at this point.



## To Turn In:
* Update your readmes.
* Describe your progress in terms of critical functionality (a few sentences would be sufficient).  What have you accomplished and what is left? Have a plan for completing any remaining critical functionality by the last day of class.
