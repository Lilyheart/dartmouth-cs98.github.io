At this stage you should be working towards a testable prototype,  it should be close to your MVP. Focus on function over form for this milestone.  You should be able to demonstrate the main critical functionality of your app at this point and now is the time to flesh it out so that it is compelling and testable.

## Demo and Testing Plan

In preparation for the DEMOs at the end of Term 1, we will need a plan!  You should consider the demos as your final exam for the term, and it is worth a ton of points. This is the moment you are working up to ‚Äî your time to shine.  

During the expo you will present your work to various people, including your instructor. As a heads up, for the grading part what we'll be looking for:

* During DEMO:
  * Verbal project pitch and user onboarding.
    * verbal pitch should be 1 minute tops.
    * purpose of the product motivated
  * Testing questions prepared / notes taken
  * How much of the MVP functionality was functional
  * Was the primary critical functionality testable
* Online Submission:
  * collaborative coding (usage of PRs/issues)
  * overall difficulty rating of what you attempted
  * user testing summary and debrief
    * with some data analysis
    * observations recorded
    * insights/conclusions
  * readmes current with environment setup

To prepare for this let's come up with a feature prioritization plan!  Create a new Wiki Page named:  `Term 1 Demo Features`

```markdown
# Term 1 Demos Feature Prioritization

## Critical Features

* üî•list of features from MVP (with due dates)
* üî•link each to github issue
* üî•start with what you had for your original feature spec and update

## Secondary Features

* üç¶ break out less important but would like to have features here (with potential due dates)

## Non Critical

* ‚õî identify features that don't need to be done this term here

```

## Signoff

Each team will need to get instructor signoff on this.



## GitHub Milestones

![](img/milestonesview.jpg){: .fancy .medium}

If you haven't been using [github milestones](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests/) this is a nice way of grouping issues with due dates.  It isn't required but extra credit if you do use them.
