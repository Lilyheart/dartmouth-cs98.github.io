At this stage you should be working towards a testable prototype,  it should be close to your MVP. Focus on function over form for this milestone.  You should be able to demonstrate all the main critical functionality of your app at this point.

## GitHub Milestones

![](img/milestonesview.jpg){: .fancy .medium}

If you haven't been using github milestones we're going to start now! Create 2 milestones BugHunt and DEMOS. Dates for these are:  Nov 7th for BugHunt and Nov 14th for DEMOS.  Organize existing issues so that you've prioritized things necessary for testing.  Think about the critical features that need to be finished.  Remember each issue shouldn't be more than an hour or two of work for one person. This will help you keep track of what needs to be done.


## To Turn In:
* Update your readmes.
* Describe your progress in terms of critical functionality (a few sentences would be sufficient).  What have you accomplished and what is left?
* Create 2 github milestones and assign issues into them.
