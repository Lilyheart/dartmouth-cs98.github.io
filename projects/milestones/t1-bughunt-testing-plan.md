Each team should be prepared to demo what they have currently and to discuss their progress. We'll offer bug rewards in the form of snacks! Bugs will need to be submitted in the form of git issues on each others repositories. PR's are extra credit!

Reported bugs should be checked against duplicates already filed.  If you accidentally file a duplicate you should reference it from the original and close it so it doesn't clutter the repo.  Additionally, bugs should attempt to be helpful and insightful and will be judged by whether they help the team.

Finally you should engage with opened issues - if it is something that isn't an issue - mark it that way and close it. If it is something you fix, reference the commit or PR that you fixed it in and close it.  If you have questions about the issue, comment on it.  If you filed an issue and the team asks you about it it is your responsibility to be responsive.



## Testing Plan

Also, you should think about a plan for testing.  Are there any assumptions about your product that you might want to test?   Take careful observational notes.  Come up with a set of questions to ask each tester: one set for after their first pass at using your product and then also in a few days after they have had some time with it.  Avoid asking questions like: "did you enjoy our product / find it useful".  These types of questions often suffer from various [response biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias).  Survey subjects often suffer from acquiescence bias and try to give you the answer they think you want. So the trick is to construct questions that are balanced and ask for specifics.

Likert scale questions are often used in surveys (usually these are 5 point scales from strongly disagree to agree).  Sometimes you can avoid the middle undecided value and force subjects to either agree or disagree which can be helpful if your subjects are timid. Good Likert questions might look like:  "I prefer functionality X over Y", "Would feature X improve the product", "logging in is important for this app".  Try to avoid leading questions and have a mix of questions where some you can evaluate numerically and some free form comments.

The goal is to inform your further development.  At this point you don't need to know if people like your app or not, but you do want to know if there are concrete ways to improve it.


## To Turn In:

* github urls to at least 3 issues that you opened on other projects repositories
* each team is required to engage with the issues opened
* any EC pull request urls
