![](img/pitch.gif){: .fancy .medium}

A MAX 3 minute presentation with a little bit of Q&A to pitch your idea to the class. You can pitch with **at most 1** other person.

## The Pitch:

* Motivate idea / the problem, tell a story! Everyone loves stories.
* Propose either:
  * a potential solution
  * OR pose a problem you want to attempt to solve without a solution
  * OR even just a topic that you think might be interesting to brainstorm around
* Discuss any insights you might have into the problem

You can use a short slide deck but keep it very visual with *at most 10 words* on any individual slide!

Please, don't be shy, your idea is great! Pitch cause you care. Pitch for the practice. PitchÂ to make a difference. Pitch to inspire!

Some thoughts:
* There are [lots of fascinating apis](https://www.programmableweb.com/) out there: from beer reviews to machine learning, and vision apis, to fictional datasets. Could you integrate some of these to enhance your idea?
* Games, could you take some known game and make it a site or mobile app?
* Is there an existing product that you want to clone but with a special take.  Uber for puppies, airbnb for breakfast sandwiches, cryptocurrencies for goldfish?
* Your ideas can be serious, world changing, or completely silly.  The point is to enjoy building something cool.

Once teams are created around these pitches, you will have an opportunity to brainstorm/pivot/contribute a bit more as a team so **these don't lock you in**.

## Background Research

Don't forget to do some background research.  Sometimes a brief google will show lots of other approaches to the problem. That does not mean your approach isn't valuable.  However the first questions people ask are: doesn't that already exist?  isn't that just instagram?

You need to be prepared to defend why your approach is better/different/revolutionary/etc.  


## To Turn In:

* slides created in shared google presentation
* name of your pitch partner if you have one
* working title
* max 8 word tagline
