## To Start

Create a Google doc or [InVision Board](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205249269-Introduction-to-Boards) that you'll use to collect ideas and inspiration. *If you prefer pintrest or other platform feel free to substitute.*


## Overview

As you think about what you'd like to spend the next 6 months working on, keep a list of things that inspire you. These can be clipped images of cool things, digital or physical designs that you like, color palettes, links to videos, inspirational sites, ideas of your own, or ideas from your friends and enemies.


## To Turn In

* URL to inspiration board via google, invision board, or whatever.
