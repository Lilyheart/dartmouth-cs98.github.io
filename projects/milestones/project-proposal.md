This will be a short document outlining your plans for the project.

Your project proposal describes the concept and core components of your project. This is not contractual, and we'll remain agile as we work. Hoewver, it is helpful to get all your thoughts down and to choose a direction. Remember, testable MVP in 6-7 weeks from now! 

You should craft it together as a team, preferrably during an in person meeting. 

ðŸš€ Create a wiki page `Project Proposal` with the following template.

We will dive deeper into figuring out specific features in [Feature Spec](feature-spec/) but take a quick pass at the most critical feature or two.  How is your solution solving your problem?
