Demos are now done!  Hopefully, everything worked perfectly.  One last thing left to do.  Make sure all your readme's are updated and that getting the project up and running for testing is possible based on your documentation.  Submit a debrief of the term and your team survey.

## To Turn In:

* github urls for your final project
* README.md files need to all be up to date with
  * update any setup/deployment steps (make sure a new user can set it up)
* a brief summary / debrief of this term including:
  * what worked this term / didnâ€™t work
  * a rundown of your user testing, any responses/observations
  * brief summary of any insights / conclusions drawn
  * any potential next steps
* make sure to fill out the team survey
