The feature spec is a document that is a walk-though of your project from the users perspective. It provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. The feature spec functions as your overall plan for the project. Rather than thinking about it as locking you in, use this as an opportunity to think through your product in detail. Think of it as a living document, donâ€™t be afraid to change it later as your ideas about the project mature. It does not need to be an exhaustive document. Joel Spolsky (of Stackoverflow and more recently Trello) has a nice writeup of the why and how of specs here: [joelonsoftware](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html). He references an [overly long example](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WhatTimeIsIt.html). Weâ€™ll simplify things a little bit and keep our document shorter and although he says only one person should write the spec, you should definitely do this as your whole team!  Here's some more [tips on feature specs](https://medium.com/dali-lab/9-ideas-for-more-useful-feature-specs-7ca5c679ca3c).

For our needs â€” the feature spec is a listing of what you think you need to build this term to be able to prove out your idea. 

*Outline a proposed development strategy with general feature milestones. Identify minimum viable product (MVP) features and optional stretch goals. Create a list of features that are needed to be able to do some product validation. At the end of the term you'll need to show something that is testable or viewable by a public audience.*

ðŸš€ Create a wiki page `Feature Spec` and use the following template. You may modify it as you see fit. Most of these you will pull from your user personas.

# Feature Spec

## Critical Features
*These are the primary most important features. The product doesn't have a purpose without these features. These are sometimes the harder things, but the most necessary to start tackling early to get validation. Try to list these in order that they happen in the user experience.*

* list your features | priority 1-10 | estimate effort 1-40 (1 person hours-ish)
* main functionality thing | priority 10 | effort 12
* other thing | priority 3 | effort 2

## Secondary Features
*These are features that make the product more usable, but can be hacked around if necessary. Things like login/auth might go here (unless you are building a security product).*

* list your features | priority 2 | effort 1

## Stretch Goals
* Self explanatory. Things not quite critical but would be really cool.

* list your features | priority 2 | effort 1
