The feature spec is a document that is a walk-though of your project from the users perspective. It provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. The feature spec functions as your overall plan for the project. Rather than thinking about it as locking you in, use this as an opportunity to think through your product in detail. Think of it as a living document, don’t be afraid to change it later as your ideas about the project mature. It does not need to be an exhaustive document. Joel Spolsky (of Stackoverflow and more recently Trello) has a nice writeup of the why and how of specs here: [joelonsoftware](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html). He references an [overly long example](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WhatTimeIsIt.html). We’ll simplify things a little bit and keep our document shorter and although he says only one person should write the spec, you should definitely do this as your whole team!

## But Wait

To get to this list of features — we're going to first make up some users.  These are people who would buy/user/interact with/are stakeholders in your product.  Their needs and desires will drive our features — so they need to exist first.

## User Stories and Personas

User stories are short scenarios about how your product is used.  User personas are the fictional individuals who comprise your product's users.  Your personas should have names and believable backgrounds.  They should have specific demonstrative use cases for your product.  You will refer to them as you work on the product and you'll find they will be quite useful!  The aim of user stories is to codify specific use cases for your product and allow them to be easily communicated as you build the product.  They help keep the team focused on the functionality of the product for specific people rather than getting sidetracked by features that seem "cool" or "look good".  For every feature in your spec you should have a user persona that would find it useful or compelling. You can use [userforge.com](http://userforge.com) if you want to as it provides a nice interface for creating them.

## Buddy Teams

You'll be assigned a buddy team for the rest of this term.  Your buddy team will be helpful in doing code reviews, testing out your product, helping bounce ideas around, AND embodying your user personas.

Together with your buddy team, construct some user personas for each other.  Each person will have a persona that they play.  They'll have a new name and a new past.

__Structure your user persona like so:__

* Background and Demographic Information
  * __Fictional Name__
  * __Buddy Team Member__
  * __Sketch/Picture__
  * __Demographic__ (short)
  * __Overheard quote__
  * __Short narrative__ or description about the user and why they're using your product/service.
    <br>*(try to capture their attitudes, needs, problems/concerns, and experience)*
* Behavioral and Dimensional Information
  * __Goals and Motivations__
    <br>*(goals should directly relate to product/service)*
  * __Tasks__
    <br>*(break goals down into tasks — what does the user need to do to accomplish a particular goal)*
  * __Pain Points__, Concerns, and challenges
    <br>*(what are they worried about? what do they have trouble with?)*
  * __User Flow__
    <br>*(describe a typical scenario of the user interacting with your product – this is a short ordered list of actions)*


Once you have the user personas the feature list for your spec grows easily out of it.  You already know what the users want to do — summarize and prioritize.

We'll use these throughout the milestones, so you should like your persona and take part in creating it.


## GitHub Wiki

We'll be using github wikis to keep track of some project documentation. If you haven't used it before [here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/). And some tips on using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## To Turn In:

* GitHub repository URL to wiki page you created that includes:
  * User personas that you created for your buddy team - can be on wiki *or* linked to on wiki but hosted on [userforge.com](http://userforge.com).
  * Feature Spec as wiki page in your GitHub repo:
    * A list of features, for example:
      * logins
      * profile with name, birthday
      * feed view
      * calculating summary graphs of activity
      (please do not make this exhaustive. No need to talk about which buttons are available on each page — just which general action a user would take on that page)
