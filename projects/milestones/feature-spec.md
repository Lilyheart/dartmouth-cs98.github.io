The feature spec is a document that is a walk-though of your project from the users perspective. It provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. The feature spec functions as your overall plan for the project. Rather than thinking about it as locking you in, use this as an opportunity to think through your product in detail. Think of it as a living document, don’t be afraid to change it later as your ideas about the project mature. It does not need to be an overly extensive document. Joel Spolsky (of Stackoverflow and more recently Trello) has a nice writeup of the why and how of specs here: [joelonsoftware](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html). He references an [overly long example](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WhatTimeIsIt.html). We’ll simplify things a little bit and keep our document shorter and although he says only one person should write the spec, you should definitely do this as your whole team!

## User Stories and Personas

User stories are short scenarios about how your product is used. User personas are the fictional individuals who comprise your product’s users. Your personas should have names and believable backgrounds. They should have specific demonstrative use cases for your product. You will refer to them as you work on the product and you’ll find they will be quite useful! The aim of user stories is to codify specific use cases for your product and allow them to be easily communicated as you build the product. They help keep the team focused on the functionality of the product for specific people rather than getting sidetracked by features that seem “cool” or “look good”. For every feature in your spec you should have a user persona that would find it useful or compelling.

## To Turn In:

Overall this document does not need to be super extensive, it should cover the features and be a compelling story about your product, but it doesn’t need to be a million pages.

* Feature Spec Doc (google doc share link):
  * Short short short summary intro to the project copied from project proposal.
  * Short walkthrough of the app. Can be broken down into bulleted action steps.
  * Brief list of views, for example:
    * login page
    * profile with name, birthday
    * feed view
    (please do not make this exhaustive. No need to talk about which buttons are available on each page — just which general action a user would take on that page)
* At least 3 user stories
