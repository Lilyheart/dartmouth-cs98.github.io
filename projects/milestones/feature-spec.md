The feature spec is a document that is a walk-though of your project from the users perspective. It provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. The feature spec functions as your overall plan for the project. Rather than thinking about it as locking you in, use this as an opportunity to think through your product in detail. Think of it as a living document, don’t be afraid to change it later as your ideas about the project mature. It does not need to be an overly extensive document. Joel Spolsky (of Stackoverflow and more recently Trello) has a nice writeup of the why and how of specs here: [joelonsoftware](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html). He references an [overly long example](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WhatTimeIsIt.html). We’ll simplify things a little bit and keep our document shorter and although he says only one person should write the spec, you should definitely do this as your whole team!

## User Stories and Personas

User stories are short scenarios about how your product is used.  User personas are the fictional individuals who comprise your product's users.  Your personas should have names and believable backgrounds.  They should have specific demonstrative use cases for your product.  You will refer to them as you work on the product and you'll find they will be quite useful!  The aim of user stories is to codify specific use cases for your product and allow them to be easily communicated as you build the product.  They help keep the team focused on the functionality of the product for specific people rather than getting sidetracked by features that seem "cool" or "look good".  For every feature in your spec you should have a user persona that would find it useful or compelling. You can use [userforge.com](http://userforge.com) if you want to as it provides a nice interface for creating them.

__Structure your user persona like so:__

* Background and Demographic Information
  * __Name__
  * __Sketch/Picture__
  * __Demographic info__ (short)
  * __Overheard quote__
  * __Short narrative__ or description about the user and why they're using your product/service.
    <br>*(try to capture their attitudes, needs, problems/concerns, and experience)*
* Behavioral and Dimensional Information
  * __Goals and Motivations__
    <br>*(goals should directly relate to product/service)*
  * __Tasks__
    <br>*(break goals down into tasks — what does the user need to do to accomplish a particular goal)*
  * __Pain Points__, Concerns, and challenges
    <br>*(what are they worried about? what do they have trouble with?)*
  * __User Flow__
    <br>*(describe a typical scenario of the user interacting with your product – this is a short ordered list of actions)*


Once you have the user personas the feature list for your spec grows easily out of it.  You already know what the users want to do — summarize and prioritize.


## Github Markdown Files and Repo

We'll use this opportunity to get your first project repo started!  We'll be using github classroom to autoprovision repositories and set up teams.

Every member on your team **must** use github classroom to set up the teams correctly and automatically.  Choose your term and section below:

* [CS98 Section 1 starting in 17F](https://classroom.github.com/g/Q8mwfkT2)
* CS98 Section 2 starting in 18W

The first person on your team will name the repo and the team. Each consecutive person will simply choose the repo and team to be granted permissions. Please use this as it keeps everything organized and in one place.  Once your team is created you will be able to create additional repositories as necessary within the cs98 github organization.

## To Turn In:

Overall this document does not need to be super extensive, it should cover the features and be a compelling story about your product, but it doesn’t need to be a million pages.

* Feature Spec Doc as a [featurespec.md](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file in github repo:
  * A list of features, for example:
    * logins
    * profile with name, birthday
    * feed view
    * calculating summary graphs of activity
    (please do not make this exhaustive. No need to talk about which buttons are available on each page — just which general action a user would take on that page)
* At least 3 short AND fun user stories - can be in markdown file or [userforge.com](http://userforge.com)
