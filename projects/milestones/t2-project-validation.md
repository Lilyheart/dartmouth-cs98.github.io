## Overview 

It is time to revisit your team goals and see how you are doing.  In particular, you should try to imagine where you want to be in 4 weeks. And most importantly, let us think about what success means for us, individually, as a team, as a product, and as a class.

## Team Success Metrics

As a team, gather your ideas together and go around and let everyone discuss where they see the project headed and propose some success metrics and goals for the group as a whole. 

## Wiki Page

Create a wiki page on your github repo called: `Success Metrics and Validation Plan`


```markdown
# Success Metrics and Validation Plan

## Team Goals
*Discuss and identify any team goals that you think would be important to tackle.*

* ex: we finish complex features x, y, z as they are critical to our product
* ex: we need to include this additional stretch goal as it is very cool
* ex: we want to try including analytics and doing advertising

## Success Metrics
*what are some success metrics for you as a team?*

* ex: we publish and get 100 people to download it
* ex: we don't kill each other one week before demos
* ex: we show that our process works with numerical analysis of performance data
* ex: we are the favorite team and we get a lunch voucher to get brunch with the prof

## Validation Plan
*now comes the hard part, the validation plan. how do you get from goals to success metrics that are validated? this can be user testing, performance metrics, a public demo, etc. if you feel stuck talk to us about it.*

* ex: we use analytics to show that feature x is important
* ex: we plan to demo our product to 50 people and observe and survey them to show that our product is impactful
* ex: we will use a set of tests to run our product through its steps and see how it performs in a preset number of situations
