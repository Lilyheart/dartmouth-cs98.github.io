## Overview 

It is time to revisit your team goals to see how you are doing and plan for how you will validate your project.  You should try to imagine where you want to be at the end of the term. And most importantly, think about what success means for all of us, individually, as a team, as a product, and as a class.

Recall your personal success goals and take a look back at your Project Self Reflection from the start of term.  As a team, gather your ideas together and go around and let everyone discuss where they see the project headed and propose some success metrics and goals for the project. 

Is your final validation a published app with lots of users?  Is it methods validation that you write up and present in a scientific format such as a poster?  What results do you have to get to consider the project idea validated?  Discuss and decide on what makes most sense for the project.  Not all projects have the same goals, if you have a consumer app iterating and collecting usage analytics based on real user input may be a goal,  if you are prototyping a novel interaction you may want to have some public showcase where you collect observations, and if your project has a data or computational aspect that could be validated via performance analysis you may consider a paper/poster that discusses your results.

‚ùì Why is this important?
üñê Your validation plan is what your project is really about. You have some idea, how do you show that it worked?  This is where you prove something about the project.  Remember your initial problem statement, you may have a revised problem statement, but the important question is, does your solution solve that problem.

# Success Metrics and Validation Plan

## Team Goals
*Discuss and identify any team goals that you think would be important to tackle.*

* ex: we finish complex features x, y, z as they are critical to our product
* ex: we need to include this additional stretch goal as it is very cool
* ex: we want to try including analytics and doing advertising

## Success Metrics
*what are some success metrics for you as a team?*

* ex: we publish and get 100 people to download it
* ex: we don't kill each other one week before demos
* ex: we show that our process works with numerical analysis of performance data
* ex: we are the favorite team and we get a lunch voucher to get brunch with the prof

## Validation Plan
*now comes the hard part, the validation plan. how do you get from goals to success metrics that are validated? this can be user testing, performance metrics, a public demo, etc. if you feel stuck talk to us about it.*

* ex: we use analytics to show that feature x is important
* ex: we plan to demo our product to 50 people and observe and survey them to show that our product is impactful
* ex: we will use a set of tests to run our product through its steps and see how it performs in a preset number of situations
