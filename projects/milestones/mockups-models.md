## Mockups/Sketches
Based on the various features and pages you described in the feature spec, draw up sketches of each view. Napkin style quick sketches are a good place to start. Focus more on thinking through the common actions that the users will be making rather than how and where the buttons go. As you draw out these sketches with your team several things will come to light, features you might have missed or interactions that need to be changed. Make your sketches comprehensive, they should cover all the views and functionality that your apps needs. Additionally you should make a site map style overview showing how the views are connected. Don’t worry too much about making pixel perfect designs, once you have some sketches, refine them and feel free to make them pretty. It’s more important to think through layout and functionality than making sure your color scheme or logo are perfect as you can continue to iterate on those. I recommend against most wireframing software, for wireframing you might as well just sketch on paper. Once you are ready to make it prettier just go straight into a tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). There are many good design resources out there. [Here’s one](http://cdn.ustwo.com/PPP/PP3.pdf) about pixel perfect design.

## Data Models
This is also a good time to plan out some of your data models.  Consider what data you need for your project and figure out some of the fields and objects.  You don't need to create a full relational model, but do consider what your data should look like. Describe the objects you think you will need (an informal schema for your data).

## To Turn In:
* Mockups
* Sketches of each view of your product
* A site map showing how your views interconnect
* Data Models
