## Stakeholders

Before we dive deeper into what we are building, we should talk about who the stakeholders are.  

Stakeholders are anybody who gives a damn about what you are building. These can be your end users, founding team, investors, clients, customers, parents, and professor.  Regardless of what you are building, there are most likely humans involved. Actually, stakeholders can also be non-humans in the case where you are building something for animals or aliens. 

## Feature list

At some point soon, you'll need a list of features that you will work off of. To get to this list of features â€” we're going to first make up some users. Their needs and desires will drive our features â€” so they need to exist first. *Expecto Patronum.*

## User Stories and Personas

User stories are short scenarios about how your product is used.  User personas are the fictional individuals who comprise your product's users.  Your personas should have names and believable backgrounds.  They should have specific demonstrative use cases for your product.  You will refer to them as you work on the product and you'll find they will be quite useful!  The aim of user stories is to codify specific use cases for your product and allow them to be easily communicated as you build the product.  They help keep the team focused on the functionality of the product for specific people rather than getting sidetracked by features that seem "cool" or "look good".  For every feature in your spec you should have a user persona that would find it useful or compelling.

We'll store our Personas as [Issues in our github repos](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). We'll dig into that more later but for now - go to your main repo. 

ðŸš€ Create a new issue and new label `user-personas`.  This way you'll be able to reference them later and assign them!

__Structure your user persona like so:__

```markdown
# UserPersonaName

![sketch/picture](http://usr/to/image)

## Background and Demographic Information
  * _Fictional Name_:
  * _Demographics_: (short)
  * _Overheard quote_:

## Narrative

*Short narrative or description about the user and why they're using your product/service (try to capture their attitudes, needs, problems/concerns, and experience)*

 
## Behavioral and Dimensional Information
  * __Goals and Motivations:__
    *(goals should directly relate to product/service)*
  * __Tasks:__
    *(break goals down into tasks â€” what does the user need to do to accomplish a particular goal)*
  * __Pain Points, Concerns, and Challenges:__
    *(what are they worried about? what do they have trouble with?)*
  * _User Flow_
    *(describe a typical scenario of the user interacting with your product â€“ this is a short ordered list of actions)*
```


Once you have the user personas they will help a great deal in figuring out your essential features and thinking more deeply about what you are building.

## Making the Imaginary Real

To make these user personas a bit more useful â€” we'll swap user personas once they are created.  Each of you will take on a user persona from **another team** and be a tester for them.  These will be done as trading cards, so please do have images attached. 


## To Turn In:

* GitHub URLS for each user persona created. You should create 1 per member on your team.
