Let's revisit some of our stretch goals and try to push ourselves a little bit.

Take a look at your wiki pages: original project proposal, feature spec, and more importantly the [self-reflection](project-self-reflection) from this term.   What did you mark as stretch goals?  How much does that vision reflect where you are now?

Think about what would personally be a stretch goal you would love to see implemented by the end of term.  Think about what would make you extra proud of the project.  Is it something you had already personally hoped would be part of the core functionality?  Why isn't it and what is the limitation?

Pair up with someone else from the class - anybody - try talking to someone new! and discuss your stretch goals and practice justifying them / pitching them to your own team.  

When you get back to your team - gather your ideas together and go around and let everyone pitch why they think this goal is a priority.

## Wiki Page

Create a wiki page on your github repo called: Stretch Goal Evaluation

* Each team member should write down their stretch goal
* Include a brief summary of your team discussion
* Choose 1 stretch goal that as a team you will strive for in the next couple of weeks
    * make a milestone with github issues for it


## To Turn In:
* Individually (canvas personal stretch goals):
  * describe a stretch goal that you would personally like for your project to accomplish, why do you feel it is critical, what is standing in your way?
  * submit who you partnered up with to discuss this
  * and how you felt presenting it to the team went (very short).
* As a team (canvas group stretch goals):
    * turn in your stretch goals wiki page
    * and your selected stretch goal milestone and github issues
