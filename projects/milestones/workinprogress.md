Keep going, you're doing great!  Show some progress. Do well. Make pretty code.

This milestone will be individual - please submit 1 or 2 substantial pull requests with why you are proud of them. If you haven't been doing pull requests... ðŸ˜§  well now is your time to start!

Please explain why you around proud of the PR as a comment on github on that PR!  

Your pull request should be a few hours of work and an issue or two closed.  Scaffolding code may not be sufficient since often it may come from a tutorial or previous code â€” so try to make these PR's that relate to your main critical functionality.

Also â€” your PR needs to have been reviewed.

Also â€” you need to submit a link to a PR that YOU reviewed.

So 3 links, is that so much to ask?

## To Turn In:
* Individually, a link to a PR or two that you are proud of with a couple of sentences as a github comment on the PR about why you are proud of it and how it was important for the project.  Remember you should all be doing pull requests - not pushing commits directly.
* Individually, a link to 1 PR that you reviewed.
* Don't forget to go for 5 closed issues on github per person per week.
