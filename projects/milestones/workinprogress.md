Keep going, you're doing great!  Show some progress. Do well. Make pretty code.

This milestone will be individual - please submit 1 or 2 substantial pull requests with why you are proud of them. If you haven't been doing pull requests... ðŸ˜§  well now is your time to start!

Your pull request should be a few hours of work and an issue or two closed.  Scaffolding code may not be sufficient since often it may come from a tutorial or previous code â€” so try to make these PR's that relate to your main critical functionality.

## To Turn In:
* Individually, a link to a PR or two that you are proud of with a couple of sentences about why you are proud of it and how it was important for the project.  Remember you should all be doing pull requests - not pushing commits directly.
* Don't forget to go for 5 closed issues on github per person per week.
