Keep going, you're doing great!  Show some progress. Do well. Make pretty code.

Don't forget to keep logs of each of your meetings - and that you have scheduled at least 1 individual catch up for this term using [calendly](https://calendly.com/timofei/cs98).  Nothing specific to turn in this week except:

## To Turn In:
* Individually, a link to a PR or two that you are proud of with a couple of sentences about why you are proud of it and how it was important for the project.  Remember you should all be doing pull requests - not pushing commits directly.
* Don't forget to try for 3-5 closed issues on github per person per week.
