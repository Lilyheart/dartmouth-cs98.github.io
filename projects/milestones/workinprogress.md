Keep going, you're doing great!  Show some progress. Do well. Make pretty code.

Don't forget to keep logs of each of your meetings - and schedule at least 1 weekly catch up using [calendly](https://calendly.com/timofei/cs98).  Nothing specific to turn in this week except:

## To Turn In:
* Individually, a link to a PR that you are proud of with a sentence about why.
