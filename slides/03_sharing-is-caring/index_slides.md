    * close out sprint 1 (due Sunday night)
    * evaluate and plan sprint 2 (due Monday night)
* **WinterSpring**:
    * hack-a-thing2 (due Thursday before class)
    * present a paper/article (due Monday before class)
    * will send out team form


???
* should this be a project? 
* will send out details about the present a paper thing tonight
* hack-a-thing2 - get some ideas from your peers - ask me on slack if you want some advice on cool tech.  i recommend ar or vr with unity, mobile with react-native, something with voice, maybe alexa
* we have some extra alexa funding for a team, but alexa is pretty limited so it could be part of a solution

* and share experiences with what you built - i want to see also
