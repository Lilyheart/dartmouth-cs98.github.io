name:  Positive Feedback Selections

* Phenomenal capstone experience
* this course is a blessing. 
* So far I'm having a blast, love to have a project that I feel is my own!
* I love working with my team and truly appreciate the ability to pick a project and go with it.
* The part where we could play with new technologies really helped us see the different kinds of products we could design.
* This has been one of my favorite classes at Dartmouth.
* I really loved working with my team and building a project that has real-word applications
* Classes were fun/less bureaucratic(?) than other classes
* I have enjoyed all of it  The exercises we went through were helpful in aiding me to think of outside of the box ideas.
* The collaborative environment
* I worked to teach myself a lot and learn from my teammates




???
* collaboration, team, ownership, fun
* there were lots of other great ideas - which i won't go into detail, but suffice to say there changes in term1 and some in term2 also!  if your idea wasn't mentioned don't worry i'm going through all of them

* Per team milestones in ZENHUB - with due dates and accountability
* sprints will be graded
* Individual Code Reviews with meee!
* More clarification and feedback along the way
* Pride


???
* how did the first pass at ZenHub go - shall we discuss more?
* generally i've realized that i'm more lenient in the beginning (for all classes)
* when people are learning and such
* but then get stricter/harsher as time goes on
* it is more optimal to go the other way, but i'm bad at that
* so full disclaimer
* what makes me proud:
  * polished experience
  * any shortcuts are hidden (no user workarounds)
  * you taking pride in your work
  * commitment to the project from everyone on the team
  * visible care taken:
    * documentation
    * thinking through use cases
    * no bugs
  * beauty - this is a tricky one -
