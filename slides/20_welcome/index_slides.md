name:  Critical Feedback Summary

* providing specific tutorials / assignments +4
* use x-hour +2
* more critical feedback +5
* more frequent in-person check ins / in class consultation time +5
* need less emphasis on lectures and more group coding and Q&A sessions ?
* more food üçï +1
* idea generation and time spent at beginning was good +4
* less gifs
* I'm spending 30+ hours on the project because others are slacking off
* sprint transitions weren't very structured/well organized 
* don't fully understand how we'll be graded, but to be fair we don't find that out until the second term, so maybe the final grade after end of term demos will shed some light.
* had some trouble keeping track of course deadlines for assignments 

???
* the gifs are there to keep me awake, but i'll try with fewer
* i thought canvas sent out notifactions when assigned are published, since it doesn't i'll be more mindful
* we'll grade monday mornings - so be prepared

name:  Positive Feedback Selections

* Every year the class becomes less of a layup. üëç
* this course is a blessing. 
* Everything seemed quite adequate and necessary.
* I really like creating something from start to finish
* The part where we could play with new technologies really helped us see the different kinds of products we could design.
* There is a collaborative environment that is fostered in the classroom every day - people are kind to one another and are willing to help each other
* It's allowing me to build a real project and apply the things I've learned throughout my major!
* I had a lot of fun working with new technologies that I didn't have the opportunity to learn in other classes
* I have enjoyed all of it  The exercises we went through were helpful in aiding me to think of outside of the box ideas.
* I enjoy doing group work and also enjoyed the tutorials in the beginning of the term.
* I think the group style of the course makes for a better learning experience. On top of that, having the ability to create my own idea with other people that I work well with is incredible.



???
* collaboration, team, ownership, fun
* there were lots of other great ideas - which i won't go into detail, but suffice to say there changes in term1 and some in term2 also!  if your idea wasn't mentioned don't worry i'm going through all of them

* what makes me proud:
  * polished experience

  * you taking pride in your work
  * commitment to the project from everyone on the team
  * visible care taken:
    * documentation
    * thinking through use cases
    * no bugs
  * beauty - this is a tricky one -

* more arts and crafts time!

name: This Week

* today: retrospective
* today/tomorrow: plan sprint 1
* end of week: personal success
* all the time: update designs

???
* the idea here is to gather all your thoughts from demos and feedback and figure out where you collectively want to go to next
*  updating designs so you know what you're buidling is helpful.  also there are design starter packs for figma that might help with look and feel if you want - i can share one
