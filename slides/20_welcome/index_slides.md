* Too slow to start, might’ve been nice to **start building 1 week earlier** +10
* Maybe check in a bit more frequently to see if we’re on track +3
* felt the **code experimenting did not really come in handy** when the actual projects started
* **project pitches could come first**, and then based on all the different ideas people can then start investigating tech stacks
* Was sometimes unclear on where feedback was coming through - the canvas comments section is somewhat obscure and not as intuitive as an email or slack message might have been +2
* should be a more **organized system for speaking with the professor**. Maybe a queue on the whiteboard?


???
* will switch to compiling feedback into slack - thinking of ditching canvas altogether 
* current section moving everything up a week and doing second hack-a-thing after the pitches instead - great idea.

* Making sure all members of a group are contributing. +2
* Technigala was a little stressful because **we didn't know when the instructors would come by**, so it would have been helpful to know what time we would all have to be at our booth
* I think this class should be held during a normal time period. The 3A/3B are disruptive and strange, although I know it's meant to limit conflicts with other classes
* *Mandating* the use of ZenHub is a very poor decision that I think most students in the class felt was unfair, and was an immense waste of time. I know Tim likes ZenHub, but it's very very far from being an industry standard: and saying that we *must* specifically use ZenHub, rather than base GitHub issue tracking, or even Jira or any other alternatives, and basing all of the weekly grading on how well we used ZenHub felt very bad. Spent a lot of time just debugging ZenHub issues instead of actually working.
* **Better group formation** and a little more **structure flexibility for different types of projects**
* We need more motivation ❗️

???
* more checkins got it!
* zenhub is pretty much identical feature wise jira asana etc - if there are strong preferences please pitch them to me, i like zenhub because it is actually just a layer on top of github issues, so if you prefer github issues, you can mostly just use that - mostly the icebox -> backlog -> in progress -> review -> done task flow is what we're looking for which is doable in lots of different systems - not sure what the zenhub debug issues are but happy to help figure them out.
* some of these i'm not sure where the problems lie - so would love to have more input on - what did people not like about the group formation?  in

* Everything was great.
* inspired us to think about how we could **create something with impact**, and empowered us to really build something we thought could make a difference. I like the way the class is an opportunity to get a taste of entrepreneurship as well as creating technology for good.
* **Group work was really fun and group matching** went well for me. I liked the emphasis on learning and development as a software engineer.
* I think **having the first few weeks as time to explore ideas/try new technologies was really good** instead of jumping right into a project.
* The extremely **realistic and creative space** to simulate developing a product in real life.

* There was a **lot of freedom** in this course, which was great. It was great to be able to work on something we were passionate about, somewhat on our own terms. The **team workflow also promoted a lot of the skills** that are super important for real-world tech jobs.
* I think the **pitches were a pretty good way of forming teams**. Also enjoyed having time to do interviews and come up with ideas. I also think having time during Tuesday and Thursday classes are really helpful in getting work done and meeting with all of our team members.
* hands-off but available-for-help approach is great for the project.
* Continue having a loose approach towards projects but pushing us along towards developing a final product.

???
* collaboration, team, ownership, fun
* there were lots of other great ideas - which i won't go into detail, but suffice to say there changes in term1 and some in term2 also!  if your idea wasn't mentioned don't worry i'm going through all of them
* tricky part is balancing out all the requirements and backgrounds

name: This Week

* today: [project self reflection](/projects/milestones/t2-project-self-reflection)
* today/tomorrow: [plan sprint 1](/projects/milestones/t2-starting-sprint)
* end of week: [personal success](/projects/milestones/t2-personal-success)
* all the time: update designs

???
* the idea here is to gather all your thoughts from demos and feedback and figure out where you collectively want to go to next
*  updating designs so you know what you're buidling is helpful.  also there are design starter packs for figma that might help with look and feel if you want - i can share one
