name: Feedbacks


* could have done a little more to help projects have real definition before diving into them 👎
* overall emphasis on design thinking was good 👍
* The hack-a-thing was a cool introduction to the term. 👍
* hack-a-thing was a cool way to start. 👍
* Lots of time wasted in beginning of term before starting project 👎
* wish we had started working on the actual projects earlier in the term 👎
* The pace of the course is perfect. 🎉

???
* takeaways:
  * potentially work on making the early milestones more relevant
  * but pretty split on hackathing

---
name: Feedbacks on Milestones

* the milestones were useful in organizing our project 👍
* milestones were a bit contrived, and compromised some of our own independence in the project 👎
* I liked the milestones and how they forced you to keep up or fall behind 👍
* Maybe more milestones later in term? Work kind of piled up at the end 👷
* More structure, exact expectations as they line up with grading would be nice. 💯

???
* takeways:
  * more even structure - more front-loaded
  * question of how to help with idea formation early
  * perhaps have info-session previous year to get people thinking?
  * we'll set up team specific milestones and there will be milestone accountability milestones - get the stuff done in the milestone or adjust them - thats the next milestone

---
name:  Feedbacks on feedback

* More rigorous standards. 📒
* sometimes it was unclear about what exactly was due (PRs vs. issues), and when/where to turn it in (on canvas?)
* attendance grade would be excellent to make sure your team isn't the only team that's not at class ⛔
* less time on bureaucratic tasks such as logging 👎
* log 10 hours a week working with your group on a cs project - cool stuff 👍
* more clarity on due dates 📅

???
* every date is on canvas
* interesting idea about attendance grade, lets do it, that simplifies things a little bit.
* I know the meeting form is annoying - buut - it does help you know that stuff is happening and helps keep track hours of effort - if amount of effort was measurable via github i'd much  prefer it.

name:  Overall
* This course was good, depends how the project turns out next term 🏄
* Not a lot – requirement for CS major. ❄️
* This is my favorite CS class so far as I get to apply what I learned. 💯
* I think it's the perfect way to end my computer science major at Dartmouth.
* great way to wrap up my cs major & i am excited for next term
* great job at moderating group cohesion, and should focus more attention on group participation.
* really enjoyable presence in classroom, cannot imagine a more approachable professor.
* added a lot of confidence in my ability to code

name:  This term

.medium[![](img/pride-rock.gif)]


* Per team milestones - with due dates and accountability
* Buddy team code reviews
* More clarification and feedback along the way
* Pride


???
* generally i've realized that i'm more lenient in the beginning (for all classes)
* when people are learning and such
* but then get stricter/harsher as time goes on
* it is more optimal to go the other way, but i'm bad at that
* so full disclaimer
* what makes me proud:
  * polished user experience
  * any shortcuts are hidden (not user workaround) (not yet)
  * you taking pride in your work
  * commitment to the project from everyone on the team
  * visible care taken:
    * documentation
