name: Today


<iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J-GVd_HLlps?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

* Interviews
* Ideas++
* Broaden our problem scope

???
* today talk about ideas and workshop out some of the interviews
* I generally dislike formal brainstorming - some of you might feel that way too
  - but hopefully this will be fun and fruitful
* goal is to broaden our scope

???

* anybody need ideas?

name: Technologies

.fancy.medium[![](img/andreessen.jpg)]

* on slack `#inspiration`
* hearables
* ar/vr
* sensors

???
* some thoughts on state of the art
* using our hearing a lot
* marc andreessen 
* i listen to audiobooks a lot - while walking or driving especially - crank through a book a week. 
* hearables
* lots of cool sensors from the stuff on your phone to cheap eeg for brainwaves and heartrate monitors

---
name: WTF hearable?

.fancy.medium[![](img/tom-cruise-hearables.jpg)]

* has additional sensors
* hearing or comprehension enhancement
* various assistants

???
* hearing is just as valuable an input
* i listen to audiobooks a lot - while walking or driving especially - crank through a book a week. 
* anyway - audio interactions - predicted to be big
* stigma of talking to oneself / hearing aid though is a thing to combat
* close to brain - eeg?
* not sure how to build off of this - prototyping something larger

* shared worlds
* collaborative vs combative
* before pokemon go came ingress

???
* niantic is doing some cool stuff - i emailed them asking about access to platform maybe 
* before pokemon go they had a game called ingress
* sent people on missions to take pictures of landmarks
* used that for pokemon go
* now they have all the walking paths that exist in the world... what will they do with that? 
* also an interesting technique - crowdsourcing the data you need by providing rewards for it

???
* not sure what the killer app here is
* but this is a beautiful realtime demo from unity
* imagine a study space / vr office though - where would it be? would it have a table? 
* studies show that context to where you remember things is important in helping recall / put you in the right mood



---
name: More Topics

.fancy.small[![](img/flyaway.gif)]


* education
* games
* behavior change (health, happiness, security)
* opensource


???
* do we think education is optimal?
* queue soap box - turns out giving students a giant textbook to read and talking at them for an hour isn't the way the brain works.  we are amazing learners - you learn language mostly just by listening - an infants brain learns phonemes and words by analyzing the distribution of sounds. probabilistic statistical learning
* pre-tty _ ba-by (transitional probabilities, that a syllable will occur given a previous) oral speach has no real boundaries
* we do this automatically.
* at 11 months old babies can distinguish grammatical from non-grammatical sentences
