???
* just some tips
* not really a designer (tried to go to graphic design school many years ago though)
* here's what I've learned from hanging around designers
* based on working on hundreds of projects


---
name: Step 1: Inspiration Board

* find examples of similar products
* take screenshots
* save urls
* copy color schemes

.fancy.medium[![](img/inspiration.jpg)]


???
* other people have made pretty designs,  look at them, use them for inspiration, copy them as best you can


---
name: Step 2: Sketches

* paper is best
* quickly jot down views and functionalities

???
* make them on paper first
* much faster
* we'll try to get to that today

---
name: Step 3: Mockups

* with inspiration and sketches
* start on mockups ([figma](http://figma.com), [sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com), etc)
* don't code them yet

.fancy.medium[![mockups](img/mockupthings.jpg)]


???
* the case for mockups:
* help you remember what needs to be built
* much quicker to play around with different options quickly and easily to determine what works best for your product
* coordinate with your team - keep everybody on track

---
name: Step 4: Functional Mockups

* put mockups together
* built in to Figma or

* PopPaper: https://marvelapp.com/pop/

.fancy.medium[[![invision](img/invision.gif)](http://invisionapp.com)]

???
* great way to test your interactions
* woop forgot some logic path from one view to another
* can run it by users and see if they can figure it out

---
name: Colors

* Not just random
* Use a color scheme chooser: [color.adobe.com](http://color.adobe.com)
* Steal from other sites

.fancy.medium[[![adobe color](img/adobecolor.gif)](http://color.adobe.com)]

???
* picking colors
* beg, borrow, steal color schemes


---
name: Hierarchy

* visual hierarchy
* what users see first, order of gaze
* visual saliency

.fancy.medium[[![fpatttern](img/fpattern2.jpeg)](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394)]


???

* laying out your page, remember to think about the visual hierarchy
* ordering of what users see based on size/color/movement
* What will users eyes see first, your call to action, or the large user profile button that they never really need to go to
* Try to imagine what you would notice first as a new user and then order your elements in terms of visual saliency appropriately
* Larger and brighter colored things tend to be noticed first
* Positioning also matters, we tend to look at things in a [letter F pattern](https://uxplanet.org/f-shaped-pattern-for-reading-content-80af79cd3394).

UX is like a joke...

???
* famous designer
* every choice you make conveys something
* you chose blue for a restaurant site because you like blue
* but blue is not appetizing, doesn't make people feel hungry - RED does weird.
* think about and defend every choice you make - 'i just like it' doesn't cut it.
* hidden interaction like swiping or hamburger - be careful.
* ux is like a joke - its bad if it needs explaining
* can use this time to test that!

name: TODAY Feature Spec + Sketches Start

 .fancy.medium[![](http://i.giphy.com/13NR9a0aYuYMy4.gif)]

* terse walk-though of project
* from users perspective
* terse listing of features
* terse+memorable user personas
* [mockups and sketches](../projects/milestones/mockups-models)

???
* A walk-though of your project from the users perspective listing out every feature that it should have
* a few user stories attached
* mockups of user experience.
* lets first finish these yes?

name:  Sketch Time Step 1: Generate Options


.fancy.medium[![](../../projects/milestones/img/papersketch.png)]

* which **(2-5) main features** you will sketch that are essential to your product
* thick markers, paper, timekeeper
* **5 minutes of individual sketching per feature** (improv rules)
* compare sketches and create group versions that incorporate the best (active agreement/disagreement)
* Aim for **2-3 versions per feature**.

???
* Fidelity is at its lowest. Use the “thick marker trick” - the thicker the marker, the more you force yourself to keep the designs at a conceptual level (it’s difficult to add in details when the marker tip is so large!). Whiteboard markers are great here too, just take photos!
* Include little or no specific content
* Drop any worries about scale, straight lines, grids, etc.
* Think in flows whenever possible (what pages come after?)
* Match your sketches with your flow diagram - what part of the flow is not yet in the sketch?
* Never settle for your first idea!
