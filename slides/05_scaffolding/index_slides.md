name: Next, planning our first sprint


.fancy.small[![](../../projects/milestones/img/rocks.gif)]

* Will do Thursday in class
* Sprint retrospectives generally to be due every Sunday night
* General idea is connect your components (client <-> server <-> db) - can get started on that early if you want.
