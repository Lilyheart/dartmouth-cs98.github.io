*Tim Tregubov*

???
* what does that even mean?
* a lot of you have had internships - working at a company
* academic course project experience
* but probably not a do your own startup experience
* from just an idea - to full product
* will be about you so if you have ideas on how to improve just talk to me



---
name: Course Goals

.medium_small[![](img/useless-box.gif)]

* learn to build from scratch
* solve problems
* software dev best practices
* ship a glorious product
* make bank, or better, change the world

???
* talk about history
* class used to be a layup
* first realized nobody had built stuff
* so added rigor for complexity
* then added rigor for idea - realized people needed to love it
* the general point here is: you have half a year, don't fucking waste it on something you don't care about.
* **in this class you have the freedom to choose to work on something you care about**

* agile workflow
* similar to products such as Asana/Jira/Basecamp/Trello
* integrated with GitHub - every ticket is an issue
* specific work issues/tickets per person to coordinate work
* mandatory, graded, **helpful**

???
* how many have used a task tracker such as Jira before?

---
name: Grading

.small[![](img/redpanda.gif)]

* Project Milestones — 50%
  * milestone weights will vary
  * late penalty: -12% of milestone per day.
* Weekly Progress: Instructor Checkins + GitHub — 35%
* Attendance/Participation - 15%
* Individual contribution scaling vs Team grade
    * Github pull requests and commits
    * Issue engagement and story points
    * Technical (craft, breadth/depth of work) *
    * Team (communication, attendance, team player) *
    * Growth (curiosity, rigor, improvement over the term) *


???
* grading is somewhat vague at least to start - you get milestones but really its the final product quality that matters - rethinking even using canvas
* will try to have individual meetings with each one of your - details to follow
* may be adjusted slightly
* your grade my vary based on individual contribution (combined metric effort+feedback+participation+github)
* weekly checkins will start once you have teams
* grumpier in my old age
* people have complained that project goals weren't clear and they were penalized about user experience issues
* "didn't realize that there would be a focus on UX and whether the project was usable"
* problem unless researchy or difficult then we can talk about pivoting / progress on solving the problem
* again talk to me if things are unclear - but can't get away with slacking

name: What you want, P1

* I just hope for one more opportunity at Dartmouth to put together what I’ve learned and **end up with a cool product**
* Would ultimately like **to do something which I'm very proud** which sounds corny but is true! 
* whatever my group's **final product is continues to be in use after the spring**
* I am super excited for this course! I really enjoyed our final project in CS52 of coming up with a product idea and quickly implementing it in a few weeks. I feel like CS98 will allow us to really delve into all aspects of our product and **produce something much more polished and fully developed**.
* I **hope to be efficient** on this project
* To have a **solid experience with teamwork and collaboration** while creating an **impactful product**.
* create a **meaningful project that can really benefit those who need help**.


???
* great my whole life my driving motivation has been to build cool things
* my  parents were artists - if i wanted a toy, they told me to make it
* want to help people have the transformative experience of creating something out of nothing.  and idea->reality

---
name: What you want, P2

* I believe a lot of technology today such as instagram filters and what not, improve the quality of our lives, but not so much **solve the necessary problems**. I would love to tackle some of those issues with this culminating experience!
* I'm extremely **excited to have a finished product that we can use and show to others**.
* It's cool to **work on something you're passionate about**.
* I’m going to be a PM after graduation so I’m really **excited to work hands-on** for the last time (for a while).

???
* the question is do you want to graduate having built something cool AND with a good grade?   when i meet with each of you individually - tell me what you want - if you want to pass and don't care, do tell me, i'll try to help make that painless so we're not fighting


---
name: What you want is what I want!

.small[![](img/against-the-world.gif)]


* Produce something of significance and impact
* Feel empowered to think of an idea and create it into being
* Be engaged and proactive on your project
* Go beyond the minimum milestone guidelines
* Collaborate with your team in a thoughtful and respectful manner
* Enjoy exploration and creation

???
* we're in this together - yes this is a required class - but it can be enjoyable for all of us



---
name: Your Questions So Far

* How is a two-term course usually structured?
* Do we pick our groups or are they assigned?
* How will we learn new technologies? Are there any class modules?





---
name: Project Complexity


.tiny.fancy[![](img/puppy-shake-head.gif)]

* What you set out to do and how far you get is considered
* code full system - minimal platforms as a services
* reasonable complexity - server/client/computation


???
* points for stretching
* some data persistance or computation
* some display of said data or computation that is reasonably complex
* it is two terms so you have time to implement something cool!
* reward for challenge - min complexity - but better grade if challenged
* will give feedback: easy - medium - hard levels
* can negotiate - time converts to complexity at some point
* past -> rigor
* 2 terms == lotta f' time



---
name: Commitment

.tiny.fancy[![](img/kitten-commitment.gif)]

* 10-15hrs a week min (outside of class)

* how many of you have had friends disappear due to doing thesis?
* we are't doing thesis
* buuuut hopefully you'll care abouut enough
* also there is honors available but requires a thesis in addition...
* honestly - the course is designed to be 10-15 hours a week
* if you spend that you'll be happy with the result
* less and your team will eventually be mad at you
* don't need to disappear completely, cause milestones will prevent procrastination



---
name: CS vs Startup

.medium.fancy[![](img/bill-nye.gif)]

* What about science?
* What about social entrepreneurship?

???
* last term someone asked CS culminating vs startup
* it can definitely be more experimental or not have a clear consumer
* but we're humans, so everything is a problem to solve
* if you want to do something algorithmic or a software library or dev tool thats fine, all the steps we take can be made to fit. 
* or a social e-ship project
* but this is NOT a research thesis - if you want hardcore research - do that

name: Problems to Solve

.small.fancy[![](img/puppyhelp.gif)]

* Considerations
  * Novelty: explore something new(ish)
  * Impact: bigger than here
  * Format: game, web, mobile, iot, wearable, etc

* There are [lots of fascinating apis](https://www.programmableweb.com/) out there: from beer reviews to machine learning, and vision apis, to fictional datasets. Could you integrate some of these to enhance your idea?

???
* some of you have ideas, don't worry but take a step back and do some more ideating
* Think outside of what is useful to Dartmouth students
* startup advice is wrong - don't always have to solve a problem you yourself face
  * we have all the same problems - finding out events/parties, waiting in line for the pong game, buying stuff
* event apps, social network clones, and marketplaces have been attempted before and you might find it more rewarding to build something that challenges you.
* sometimes can't be solved - event planning for instance - just needs everybody to use the same platform


---
name: Outside the Box?

.small.fancy[![](img/outsidethebox.gif)]

* if you had half a year to build anything you want?
* why build something boring?

???
* with a team of cool people
* consider improvements on existing things - or games
* Games, could you take some known game and make it a site or mobile app?
* Is there an existing product that you want to clone but with a special take.  Uber for puppies, airbnb for breakfast sandwiches, cryptocurrencies for goldfish?
* Your ideas can be serious, world changing, or completely silly.  The point is to enjoy building something cool.

* if you want to talk philosophy, i have office hours
* collegepulse wants to solve societal pressures and misconceptions - less people drink and have sex then people might feel pressured into believing - greater potential impact past american schools - what does it mean to black out in cultures where nobody drinks? or where drinking ages are different?
