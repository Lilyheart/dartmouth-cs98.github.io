* gonna do buddy code reviews
* welcome to our guests - our star kevin, host bryan, and amy olsen media relations

name: Buddy Team Code Reviews

.fancy[![](img/code-eww.gif)]

???
* gonna do buddy code reviews
* who has had official code reviews at in internship or something?
* how did they go?
* what should a code review look like?
* or what would you want to get out of a code review?



---
name: Code Review Types

.fancy.medium[![](img/wtf.jpg)]

* in person walkthroughs / inspections
* pull request reviews (single / multiple)

???
* today we'll do in person walkthroughs
* they are more formal that just chatting
* less formal than inspections
* and a bit more civil than this one

name: How They Help?

.fancy.small[![](img/dontknowwhy.gif)]

* *Code Complete* research:
    * design/code review: 60% *errors* caught
    * unit/function/integration: 25-45%
* "single biggest thing you can do to improve your code"
* "my code isn't done until I've gone over it with a fellow developer"
* learn from others

???
* jeff atwood - stackoverflow
* i enjoy them because it is a great chance to learn from others
* and be less embarrassed to show my work
* share your knowledge
* reading code as a way to learn


---
name: Walk through your code

.fancy.medium[![](img/code-review-2.gif)]

* don't stress it - start high level
* brief demo of product
* then walk through frontend code (main views)
* then show server and any data models
* share what works and doesn't with current architecture


???
* consider it like onboarding a new person to the project
* what do you want them to know
* if your project is rul successful and you start hiring people

---
name: Ask questions

.fancy.medium[![](img/saysomething2.gif)]

* how do you store that?
* did you consider?
* do you handle the case that?
* what is best practice?
* what does thaaat function do?


???
* if you see something say something


---
name: Things to look for?

.fancy.medium[![](img/worst-comment-ever.jpg)]

* overall architecture clear?
* confusing code/logic
* best practices (linting, commenting, naming, consistency)


???
* architecture - microservices? data storage?
* do you understand how the components fit together?
* if you needed to change something would you know where / how?
* who knows what linting is?
* platitude: code that is easy to read is easy to debug
* what are some thoughts on what makes code easy to read?



---
name: Code Style?

.fancy.medium[![](img/itslike.png)]

* can be jarring but don't harp on it
* discussion is good, but not tabs vs spaces
* are they using a style guide?


???
* mechanical style issues, like tabs vs spaces, or basic naming rules for variables, shouldnâ€™t even make it to the code review stage.
* missing linter?  yes
*  the best code reviews should provoke discussions (not tabs vs spaces)
* certainly interesting to ask if code style and why?





---
name: Error Handling?

.fancy.medium[![](img/burningbus.png)]


???
* sometimes good - but don't go overboard on this just yet
* some clear cases, input checking for instance




---
name: Be Kind

.fancy.medium[![](img/at-least.png)]

* praise cool things
* learning opportunity for all
* if you like something say something

???
* i learn more from reading others code than they know



---
name:  Comment on GitHub

.fancy.medium[![](img/new-issue.gif)]

* make comments on the github
* at least 1 issue from each of you
* connect to a specific line or range of code
* can be a question - doesn't have to be an insightful criticism
* plz to engage with them afterwards


???
* 2 issues from each of you
* at least 1 must be on a specific line or range of code
* can be a question - doesn't have to be an insightful criticism.

name:  Ok go!

.fancy.small[![](img/code-slide-slow.gif)]

<!-- * https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/29015/assignments/163454 -->

* get set up to project and decide how/who will show
* start with code walkthough
    * what is first code that executes
    * go from there through major components and logic
* each team has 30 minutes
* ask questions during walkthough
* ask to see specific things
* ask how they handle some specific case
* learn about architecture
* take notes and then go back and make issues

???
* since it is early the goal today is to get a sense of the architecture more than specifics of computations (unless that is already available)
* is helpful for the team too to make sure everybody is on the same page
