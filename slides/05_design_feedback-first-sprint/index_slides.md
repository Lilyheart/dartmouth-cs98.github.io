* also - think onboarding flow
* when you try out someones figma (or product) do you get it right away?  be a critical thinker - question assumptions even if you got a good verbal intro into the project - does it make sense to you?

1. **Create a new sprint milestone**
1. **New Bugs**
1. **Enter Feedback**
1. **Update Epics**
1. **New Subtasks**
    * create new issues
    * label them
    * assign a time estimate
1.  **Process All Issues**
    * **Later** *(Icebox)*
    * **Next** *(Backlog)*
    * **In Progress**
    * no unsorted **Unsorted** *(New Issues)*.
    * update time estimates
1. **Assign Subtasks**


???
* i know there's a lot of text in the milestone... but its not rockets science - you just have to maintain a current sprint and issues that are sorted
* as the week goes you can add issues into the new issues pile and wait until the retrospective to sort them out
* each subtask is one code session or thereabouts
* using milestones will give you a way to group your weekly tasks even when the are just parts of epics - remember epics are for long feature - milestones group tasks by week - so you can see the progress you are making
